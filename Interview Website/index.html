                    Well. When I was a young boy my Mother took me into the city to see a Tech Convention.
                    <br>She said, "Son, when you grow up will you be the saviour of the broken, incoherent, and the damned?" 
                    <br>"Will you design it? Website and the graphics....with the plans clients have made?"
