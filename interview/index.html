		<h1>A Magical Interview With Myself</h1>
		
		<h2>Why do you want to be a Designer?&mdash;
			<br> Well, when I was a young boy my Mother took me into the city 
    and said, "Son, when you grow up you must be the saviour of the incoherent, 
    the ugly and the damned."
    	<h2>What worries you about being a designer?&mdash;
    		<br>That my mom was wrong.

    	<h2>What excites you about it?&mdash;
    		<br>I am ADHD, if I am not excited you're probably in trouble.

    	<h2>What aspect of design do you gravitate towards the most?&mdash;
    		<br>Meme culture.

    	<h2>What role or responsibility does a designer play in our society? 
    		<br>To accurately and effectively communicate ideas and information.

    	<h2>What is a website?&mdash; 
    		<br>A series of letters, numbers and images thrust through a series of tubes and viewed from your hand.
